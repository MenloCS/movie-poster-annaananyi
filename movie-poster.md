# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:**  Jurassic World: Rebirth
- **Why I chose this movie:**  I chose this movie because I loved the intense action and adventure, the storyline, the humor, and all the characters

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  tension

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  Giganotosaurus
- **Why this element:**  It was the last, and hardest battle for the adventurers 

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  Making the Dino's calm and collected, make it fear inducing

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  red
- **Accent color(s):**  black, green
- **Overall mood:** dark and omniscent(warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail) jungle leaves and weeds
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting) jungle that's scary
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure) Stegosaurus
- [ ] Object/symbol centered: T-rex
- [ ] Character collage: Giganotosaurus, Velociraptor, Brachiosaurus

- **Focal point description:** middle, T-rex

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  Create me a movie poster based of off Jurassic World: Rebirth. I chose this movie because I loved the intense action and adventure, the storyline, the humor, and all the characters. ONE feeling a viewer should get from my poster is a mix tension, mystery, and fright. ONE image, object, or visual that MUST appear on my poster is main dino the Giganotosaurus. Avoid Making the Dino's calm and collected, make it fear inducing for the viewer. The Color Palette: 

- **Dominant color(s):**  red

- **Accent color(s):**  black, green

The Overall mood: is dark and omniscent

and the Composition should be

- [ ] Close-up (face/detail) jungle leaves and weeds

- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting) jungle that's scary

- [ ] Medium shot (full figure) Stegosaurus

- [ ] Object/symbol centered: T-rex

- [ ] Character collage: Giganotosaurus, Velociraptor, Brachiosaurus

- **What worked:**  All the T-rex's where made properly and appropriately 
- **What didn't work:**  It added a random symbol in the middle
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  Redraw the symbol in middle and turn it into a volcano or something more fitting.

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**   Redraw the symbol in middle and turn it into a volcano or something more fitting. make everything the same tho, just regenerate.

- **What worked:**  The t-rex' were still made in great detail 
- **What didn't work:**  It removed some of the foreground Dinos 
- **What I'll change for next attempt:** Re add the Dino in the foreground

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  

- **What worked:**  
- **What didn't work:**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  

- **What worked:**  
- **What didn't work:**  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
